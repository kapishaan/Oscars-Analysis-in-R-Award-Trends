This project is an in-depth analysis of Oscar awards and nominations from 1928 to 2022, using data to uncover patterns and trends in the film industry. 
By leveraging R for data visualization, the project explores key metrics like the number of nominations and awards won per movie, year-to-year trends, and the most successful films in Oscar history. 
Various charts such as bar graphs, box plots, and scatter plots are used to analyze the distribution of awards and nominations, the impact of external events like the Great Depression and COVID-19, and the dominance of certain films over time. 
The project provides insights into how the film industry has evolved and which movies and years were most significant. 
Through visual representations, the project highlights the factors that shaped the Oscars and offers a clear view of historical trends in cinema. 
This analysis and code are hosted on GitHub for collaborative development and further exploration.
